Even though we’ve hardly known the answers to your questions, you never stop believing in your batch! I’ll always look back fondly at our time together. Time to fly the nest! XOXO" - Larissa</p>

          <p>"I will always cherish these 6 months with you and the whole class, from not knowing where to click to creating a functional website in a team. Thank you for your patience and all the new knowledge you have 'npm installed' in me and for pushing me when I almost gave up (JavaScript Week), Grazie Mille." - Jay</p>
